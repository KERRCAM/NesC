# NesC
Aiming to eventually make fast functional compiled language built on C with custom compiler. However will be initially interpreted as i learn the basics. Doing this project to learn more about how HL and LLLs interact, and learn about how interpreters and compilers work/are made. Predicting this to take at least 5 years off my life. Also assembly
