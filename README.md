# NesC
Aiming to eventually make fast functional compiled language built on C with custom compiler. However will be initially interpreted as i learn the basics.
will add more here once there is actually something to add. 
Main guide im using to figure out basics is from https://www.youtube.com/@HelloWorldCode
Would highly reccomend to anyone looking to write their own language.
